  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
    </li>
    <li>
      In a large saucepan, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until beef is browned. Drain any
      excess fat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and sugar. Bring to a boil, then
      reduce heat and let simmer for about 30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, egg, and parmesan cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place 3 cooked lasagna noodles on
      top of the sauce. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella
      cheese. Repeat layering two more times, ending with a layer of meat sauce and a layer of mozzarella cheese on top.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until cheese is
      golden and bubbly.
