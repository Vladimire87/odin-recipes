# odin-recipes

In this project, I am building a basic recipe website as part of my learning experience with "The Odin Project". 
Currently, the website is a simple HTML site without any CSS or JavaScript.

### Features

- Simple and easy-to-use interface
- Clear and concise recipe instructions

### Future plans

- Add styling with CSS to enhance the user experience
- Implement dynamic functionality with JavaScript
